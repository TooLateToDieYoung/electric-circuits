# Current ($I$)
$$i(t)=\frac{\rm{d}q}{\rm{d}t}$$
  
Through a physical interpretation, electric current is the movement of charged particles. Therefore, electric current can be viewed as the time rate of change of electric charge.

$$\rm{d}q=i(t)\ \rm{d}t$$
$$Q=\int_{0}^{a}{i(t)\ \rm{d}t}$$

# Voltage ($V$)
$$v(q)=\frac{\rm{d}e}{\rm{d}q}$$
  
Similarly, when charges pass through regions with a voltage difference, they can only gain or lose energy. Therefore, voltage can be regarded as the work done by the electric field on the charge. It can also be understood as the change in energy acting on each charge.

$$\rm{d}e=v(q)\ \rm{d}q$$
$$E=\int_{0}^{a}{v(q)\ \rm{d}q}$$

# Power ($W$)

$$w(t)=\frac{\rm{d}e}{\rm{d}t}=\frac{\rm{d}e}{\rm{d}q}\cdot\frac{\rm{d}q}{\rm{d}t}=vi$$
$$\rm{d}e=w(t)\ \rm{d}t$$
$$E=\int_{0}^{a}{w(t)\ \rm{d}t}$$
